## Why did I want to learn Vue.js??
> I wanted to learn another frontend framework other than React.js. Compared to React, Vue.js is simpler but still similar to React. 


## I followed the tutorial above to learn Vue.JS. I learned a bunch of fundamentals within the Vue.js Framework. The fundamentals I learned include:
> - Components
> - using ref and reactive
> - Directives
> - Router
> - Using both the Options and Composition API
> - Using different lifecycle methods. Mainly using onMounted()

## Other Libraries and Modules I learned to use while creating this app:
> - Tailwind CSS
> - JSON-Server
> - Fetch/Axios
> - Toastification
